If you wanta rock me, do it gently
Stroke me with style, don't beat me half to death
Just 'cause you got a big amplifier
That don't mean you always gotta crank it higher
It isn't how loud you play-it's what you say

It you wanta soul me don't get down too funky
You get too low your message won't get through
Tryin' to get the words is aggravatin'
Especially when the singer ain't enunciatin'
It isn't how loud you play-it's what you say

And if you wanta sing of love don't make it silly
Tell it like you feel,but don't add nothin' else
When the tour's over and you're home at last
Squeeze your old lady,but make her last
It isn't how loud you play-it's what you say
